  <h1>HackerRank Python Journey</h1>
  
  <h2>From 1 Star to 4 Stars</h2>
  
  <p>This repository documents my journey on HackerRank from achieving a 1-star rating to reaching a 4-star rating in the Python programming language. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new concepts, and gain proficiency in Python through practice and challenges offered by HackerRank.</p>
  
  <h2>Progression</h2>
  
  <p>Here's a breakdown of my journey, including the topics and concepts covered at each star level:</p>
  
  <h3>1 Star</h3>
  
  <ul>

    <li>Conditional statements and loops</li>
    <li>String manipulation and operations</li>
    <li>List manipulation and operations</li>
    <li>Simple mathematical calculations</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>2 Stars</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced string manipulation and regular expressions</li>
    <li>Advanced list operations and comprehensions</li>
    <li>Dictionary and set manipulation</li>
    <li>File handling and I/O operations</li>
    <li>Exception handling and error management</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3 Stars</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, heaps)</li>
    <li>Sorting and searching algorithms</li>
    <li>Recursion and backtracking</li>
